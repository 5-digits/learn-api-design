# Learn API Design

Essential learning for people building their own API

Starting a project "***from scratch***" is a opportunity
(and privilege *few* people get). If you are *fortunate* enough to be
in that position, do not take the task lightly.

A few quotes from
[Joshua Bloch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch)'s
Google Talk on
["***How To Design A Good API and Why it Matters***"](http://youtu.be/heh4OeB9A-c)

> "*You have **one chance** to **get it right**.*" [3:17](http://youtu.be/heh4OeB9A-c?t=3m17s)

> "*A bad API can be amoung a company's greatest liabilities...
> can cause an un-ending stream of support phonecalls ...
and it can **inhibit** a company's **ability to move forward***" [2:51](http://youtu.be/heh4OeB9A-c?t=2m51s)

> "*Once you have a **bad** API, you **can't change it**,
you are pretty much **stuck with it forever**.*" [3:12](http://youtu.be/heh4OeB9A-c?t=2m51s)

## Characteristics of a Good API

+ ***Easy to learn*** (*notice the priority placement of learn-ability...*)
+ Easy to ***use*** even without documentation
+ ***Hard to misuse***.
+ Easy to read and maintain code that uses it
+ Sufficiently powerful to satisfy requirements
+ Easy to evolve
+ Appropriate to audience
